# Automated Fire Alert System (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Computer Network simulation** built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The main goal is to design an **Automated Fire Alert System** that detects fire and automatically sends alerts using a network-based infrastructure.

This project is created for **academic / course purposes** and demonstrates practical networking concepts such as IoT devices, servers, routers, switches, and alert mechanisms.
